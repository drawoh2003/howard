            <h4 class="background-it">BACKGROUND ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h4>
            <p class="it-paragraph">In my exploration of Information Technology, I've dived into various tools and languages, including C#, Visual Studio, and now Sublime Text. Each of these has provided me with unique insights into the world of programming and software development. With C#, I've delved into the realms of object-oriented programming and application development, while Visual Studio has been my go-to platform for building and debugging projects. Recently, I've been experimenting with Sublime Text, drawn to its simplicity and flexibility for coding tasks. As I continue to expand my skills and knowledge in IT, I'm eager to explore new technologies and methodologies that will enable me to innovate and create solutions that positively impact the digital landscape.</p>
